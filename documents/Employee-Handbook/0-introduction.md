About this employee handbook This employee handbook is part of your employment contract. The numbers and examples given in this book are based on a fulltime employment, unless otherwise specified, of course. Sometimes different terms and conditions apply in the case of a part-time employment. Donâ€™t hesitate to ask us about them when you have any questions.

This is what matters to us at De Voorhoede

- We complement each other and make each other better. An open culture is super important to us.
- We are a flat organization. You yourself are responsible for as many things as possible. Mistakes are allowed â€“ we can learn from them!
- We like working on new things and with new technologies. This requires a fair share of inquisitiveness.
- Weâ€™re Frontend developers. Together we determine for which type of client we want to work and what we want to be good at. Does this not happen enough to your liking? Organise a meeting, De Voorhoede-drinks or something else to bring it up.
- You yourself determine the definition of your terms and conditions of employment. We work according to a system where you can compose customized terms and conditions of employment package.
